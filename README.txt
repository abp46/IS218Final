Question 1 - What is unit testing, how is it implemented, and why is it important?

  A unit testing is a test that is created to ensure that a small block of the code or a unit is working correctly. For example, you are creating a calculator application and want to make sure that multiplication function works.  Therefore, the developer creates a small function that does the multiplication. The developer then runs this test. If the unit test passes, it will show as a green light. If the unit test fails, it will display a red light with the error message related to it.
  A unit testing, done rigth, can mean the difference between a failed project and a successful one. Unit test allows you to make big changes to code quickly, can help documentation, and could be easily migrated to a new project. Programmmers do the unit testing in order to have a correspondingly level of confidence in their programs. 
Question 2 - What is functional testing, how is it implemented, and why is it important?

Functional testing uses the actual interface rather than true/false values of function. This would do the same as if a person was interacting with the page. This is important because you can test functionality without having to go through the work of performing the tasks to check if the web page or other piece of the project functions exactly how it is expected to.

Functional testing can be applied at any level of granularity where some form of specification is available, from overall system testing to individual units. Also, functional testing is useful for revealing faults and weaknesses that can be the origin to crash the system. Talking about costumer satisfaction, the functional testing assurance to customers that the deliveres application has followed the specific requirements and will work with no issues.
Question 3 - What is the significance and usage of automated unit testing in software development?

Unit testing is significant in that you can use it to review certain portions of a project and ensure their functionality so that no other pieces can break it. This means that if two developers are working on a project that one cannot break another's code, if he does it is his responsibility to fix it.
Unit testing, also, find problems early in  the development cycle, watches the code in two dimensions which are the time and space, the development code becomes more flexible, reduces the need for manual testing, and software development will become more predictable and repeatable.
Question 4 -  Where would you commonly find automated unit testing implemented?  Can you find any documentation online that describes this and post a link to it?

Unit testing is commonly found in large companies where lots of different developers are working on a project. A paper I found online describes how this is used at Microsoft, with great reduction to bugs and problems. The link is : http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/Unit_testing_cameraReady.pdf

Question 5 -  What is test driven development and how can it improve the management and quality of software projects.

Test driven development works by first writing the test cases for a project and then filling in the code that would result in said test cases returning true. This results in better and more efficient code. This also lets code be asserted before even beginning the project rather than after as is a more usual style.
teh TDD accomplishes the idea of having a software that works  and meets the customer needs. TDD applies the same principle to programmer intent. Just as moderns compilers provide more feedback on the syntax of some code. Every few minute, TDD verifies that the code does what the programmer think it should do. If something is wrong, there are only a few lines of code to check. Mistakes are easy to find and fix.
