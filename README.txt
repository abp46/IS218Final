Question 1 - What is unit testing, how is it implemented, and why is it important?
  A unit testing is to ensure that a particular unit or a part of the code developed is working correctly. For example, I have added a form, which takes the user input, such as Name, Age, or Email. The unit test can be used to make sure the user can insert this data and able to submit the form. This way, we can verify that the functions work as we expected.
   The unit tests are implemented by writing a small code to run the particular function that you are tyring to test.  
  The unit testing is very important, because this test gives us the ability to verify that our functions are working as we expected. In adddition, this helps us to identify bugs in our code and helps us to improve the quality of our code.
