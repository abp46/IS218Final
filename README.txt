1. Unit testing uses true/false results in testing functions to determine the reliability given with values that you assert. It is important because you do not want the expected functionality of a project to fail because of some change. The assertions you make should always be the result for a working project.

2. Functional testing uses the actual interface rather than true/false values of function. This would do the same as if a person was interacting with the page. This is important because you can test functionality without having to go through the work of performing the tasks to check if the web page or other piece of the project functions exactly how it is expected to.

3. Unit testing is signifigant in that you can use it to review certain portions of a project and ensure their functionality so that no other pieces can break it. This means that if two developers are working on a project that one cannot break anothers code, if he does it is his responsibility to fix it.

4. Unit testing is commonly found in large companies where lots of different developers are working on a project. A paper I found online describes how this is used at Microsoft, with great reduction to bugs and problems. link: http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/Unit_testing_cameraReady.pdf

5. Test driven development works by first writing the test cases for a project and then filling in the code that would result in said test cases returning true. This results in better and more efficient code. This also lets code be asserted before even beginning the project rather than after as is a more usual style.
