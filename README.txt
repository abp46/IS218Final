Question 1 - What is unit testing, how is it implemented, and why is it important?
  A unit testing is a test that is created to ensure that a small block of the code or a unit is working correctly. For example, you are creating a calculator application and want to make sure that multiplication function works.  Therefore, the developer creates a small function that does the multiplication. The developer then runs this test. If the unit test passes, it will show as a green light. If the unit test fails, it will display a red light with the error message related to it.  

A unit test is very important, because it helps to minimize the number of bugs in the code. It provides the automated regression for refactoring and making small changes to the code. In simple terms, unit tests make the integration much easier. 

Question 2 - What is functional testing, how is it implemented, and why is it important?
 A functional testing is written from the user's point of view. It ensures that the system is functioning as users are expecting it to.  This test also makes sure that all the code works together to get a correct output. A functional test tests an independent piece of functionality.  An example of a functional test would be that when a user fills out the form with a country code with a number, it should display an error.

The functional testing is very important, because it guarantees that the software or an application that customers are going to receive actually works exactly as their requirements. Other importance of using functional tests is that it helps to reveal bugs, which can crash the system. So functional tests helps developers make sure that the code is working okay and that the final release of the application or software will work as it is supposed to. 

Question 3 - What is the significance and usage of automated unit testing in software development?
The significance of the automated unit testing is that it doesn't require the developers or QA to constantly checking if the unit test was a success or fail. The benefits of using automated testing is to automate repetitive tests that run for multiple builds, tests that require multiple data sets, tests that are impossible to perform manually. 

Question 4 -  Where would you commonly find automated unit testing implemented?  Can you find any documentation online that describes this and post a link to it?

Question 5 -  What is test driven development and how can it improve the management and quality of software projects.
A test driven development is a software development process which relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. The very first step for this process is to quickly add a test, which is intended to fail. After that, the developer can run tests to ensure that the test actually fails. Then they can update their code to make sure that the next test passes.
















  
=======
1. Unit testing uses true/false results in testing functions to determine the reliability given with values that you assert. It is important because you do not want the expected functionality of a project to fail because of some change. The assertions you make should always be the result for a working project.

2. Functional testing uses the actual interface rather than true/false values of function. This would do the same as if a person was interacting with the page. This is important because you can test functionality without having to go through the work of performing the tasks to check if the web page or other piece of the project functions exactly how it is expected to.

3. Unit testing is signifigant in that you can use it to review certain portions of a project and ensure their functionality so that no other pieces can break it. This means that if two developers are working on a project that one cannot break anothers code, if he does it is his responsibility to fix it.

4. Unit testing is commonly found in large companies where lots of different developers are working on a project. A paper I found online describes how this is used at Microsoft, with great reduction to bugs and problems. link: http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/Unit_testing_cameraReady.pdf

5. Test driven development works by first writing the test cases for a project and then filling in the code that would result in said test cases returning true. This results in better and more efficient code. This also lets code be asserted before even beginning the project rather than after as is a more usual style.
